        <p> We are a group of college students, who want to make education accessible to all students.
        Our website allows students to view PDF’s of books or specific chapters and text, rather than spending
        hundreds of dollars for at their college bookstore. Books are extremely expensive and many students
        are unable to afford them, so they lose potential of doing their absolute best in their curriculum.
        </p>
        <p> This brand is driven to build every student’s education so that
          everyone can have a chance to be able to access readings, without
          having to spend so much. Many students are unable to afford these
          books that are demanded from each class in the semester.
         As an average student spends about $300 a semester on books. </p>
